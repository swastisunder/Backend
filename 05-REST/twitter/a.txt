create a local array to store posts like:-
    [
        {
            id:"aksdufjhb=-516354fslljgusfb"
            username:"ssb",
            content:"i love coding"
        }
    ]

latter i want to store in localstroage

1. show posts:- 
create a index.ejs in views folder get the posts which is send in the path and using loop print all the posts
create a resourese path like '/posts' and render the index.ejs file and send the local array in parameter

2. add posts:- 
we have to create 2 paths:-
    1. to show the form (/posts/new)
    2. when submit the form then add in array using post method (/posts)

    1. create a form new.ejs to get data from users
        create a route /posts/new which render new.ejs
    2. when the from is submit then send a post req to server (/posts)
        extract the data using req.body and push in local array
        after submiting the data redirect to root path using res.redirect

    3. add a "add posts" button in index.ejs using a tag 

3. display a perticular post
create a new path (/posts/:id)
fetch the id using req.params
find the perticular id using find method
create show.ejs file and send data using (/posts/:id) path display the data
add show in detailed button in all the post in index.ejs using a tag
in new posts there is not id 
use uuid 
and when add a new post then push uuid in array

4. update
create a new route to update the form (/posts/:id/edit)
add edit button in all posts in index.ejs
show edit.ejs
in html we can't send patch request
so use method-override package to update (patch) req
then send the req using method-override 1

create a patch router (/posts/:id)
get the id using req.params
get the new content
find the post in array using find
then change the old content to new content
then redirect to root path

5. delete
add delete button to all posts in index.ejs add delete button inside a form action to "/posts/id?_method=DELETE"

create a delete route (/posts/:id)
fetch id using req.params
filter the post using filter method (p.id !== id) and save the posts in posts array
then redirect to root page
